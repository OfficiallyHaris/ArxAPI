# ArxAPI
This project is a lightweight Python tool that automates the parsing arXiv academic papers for extracting key information and metadata using arXiv API and Python PDF extracting libraries (pdfminer.six). Experimenting with arXiv's API for requesting metadata limiting the current project to arXiv. Further development will expand to other academic journals reliant on PDF extraction.
